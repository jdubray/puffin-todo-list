## Architectural Decisions

- User stories should be organized into prioritized sprints with clear grouping: first core CRUD and display, then persistence and filtering, then PWA features. This establishes a sequential dependency model where foundational functionality precedes enhancement layers.

## Conventions

- User story documents should include: clear title and description in standard format, detailed acceptance criteria with checkboxes for tracking, technical implementation notes, and code examples where relevant. Each sprint requires clear goals, dependency mapping, testing strategy, and Definition of Done criteria.
- Sprint structure for feature development follows: core operations (CRUD/display foundation), UI polish (enhanced UX), persistence (data durability), filtering (advanced features), and platform features (PWA/accessibility). This progression pattern applies across project planning.
