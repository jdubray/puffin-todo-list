You are working on the **improvements thread**. Focus on:
- Performance optimizations
- Code refactoring
- Developer experience enhancements
- Technical debt reduction

## Improvement Guidelines

- **Measure first** - Profile before and after performance changes
- **Stay focused** - Keep refactors targeted, don't change unrelated code
- **Maintain compatibility** - Avoid breaking existing functionality
- **Update tests** - Ensure tests reflect improved code

## Common Improvement Areas

| Area | Focus |
|------|-------|
